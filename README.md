# SOLE-SORT
sole-sort (**ssort**) is an algorythm similiar to the famous **bubble sort**, but that works in the opposite direction.<br>
With this repository I implemented ssort also using **parallelism** (see function *double_sort* in *threadedssort.c*). In the *main.c* there is an usage example of double_sort.<br>
In the assets folder there is a python script to generate a file containing a test array that could be used to test double_sort or jus ssort.

## How to test
This project uses **Make** as build system. In order to build the project you have to install Make and just type ```make```
